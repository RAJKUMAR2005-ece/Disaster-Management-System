Disaster Management System

The provided code is a Java Swing-based **Disaster Management System** application that allows users to input and manage disaster information. 
It features a graphical interface with text fields for disaster name, location, and severity (on a scale of 1â€“10). Users can add disaster details, which are validated for completeness and correctness, and view a list of all recorded disasters in a scrollable text area. 
The system uses an `ArrayList` to store disaster records during runtime. While functional, it can be enhanced with features like data persistence, sorting, filtering, and improved UI components for a better user experience.
